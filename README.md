# US_Names_Analysis_Course_Project

In this project, we analyzed patterns in the baby names in the United States using data of top 100 most popular male and female names across decades from 1920 to 2010, uncovering patterns in choices of initials, length of names and popularity of gender neutral names.
We utilized **R Shiny** for demonstrating interactive visualizations, illustrating different features of popularity of names.
